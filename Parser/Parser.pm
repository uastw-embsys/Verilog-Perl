=head1 NAME

Verilog::Parser - Parse Verilog language files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Verilog::Parser;

  my $parser = new Verilog::Parser;
  $string = $parser->unreadback ();
  $line   = $parser->lineno ();
  $parser->parse ($text)
  $parser->parse_file ($filename)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Verilog::Parser will tokenize a Verilog file when the parse() method is
called and invoke various callback methods.  This is useful for extracting
information and editing files while retaining all context.  For netlist
like extractions, see L<Verilog::Netlist>.

See the "Which Package" section of L<Verilog::Language> if you are unsure
which parsing package to use for a new application.

Note the parser allows some constructs that are syntax errors according to
the specification (for example "foo.bar(1)++".) This is done when the
parser can't easily detect these cases.  It's up to the consumer of the
parser to filter out such errors if it cares.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $parser = Verilog::Parser->new (args...)

Create a new Parser.

Adding "symbol_table => []" will use the specified symbol table for this
parse, and modify the array reference to include those symbols detected by
this parse.  As the SystemVerilog language requires packages and typedefs
to exist before they are referenced, you must pass the same symbol_table to
subsequent parses that are for the same compilation scope.  The internals
of this symbol_table should be considered opaque, as it will change between
package versions, and must not be modified by user code.

Adding "use_cb_{callback-name} => 0" will disable the specified callback.
By default, all callbacks will be called; disabling callbacks can greatly
speed up the parser as a large percentage of time is spent calling between
C and Perl to invoke the callbacks.  When using this feature,
use_unreadback=>0 should be used too, as since whole tokens are skipped,
skipping whitespace shouldn't matter either.

Adding "use_protected => 0" will disable callbacks on `protected regions,
which may improve performance.

Adding "use_std => 1" will add parsing of the SystemVerilog built-in std::
package, or "use_std => 0" will disable it.  If unspecified it is silently
included (no callbacks will be involed) when suspected to be necessary.

Adding "use_unreadback => 0" will disable later use of the unreadback
method, which may improve performance.

Adding "use_vars => 0" will disable contassign, defparam, pin, var and port
callbacks to Verilog::SigParser.  This can greatly speed parsing when
variable and interconnect information is not required.

Adding "use_bitselects => 1" will add parsing and interpreting of
bit-selects in busses.

=item $parser->callback_names ()

Return an array of callback function names.  This may be used to
automatically create callbacks for all functions, or to test for different
callback functionality between versions of Verilog-Perl.

=item $parser->eof ()

Indicate the end of the input stream.  All incomplete tokens will be parsed
and all remaining callbacks completed.

=item $parser->filename ($set)

Return (if $set is undefined) or set current filename.

=item $parser->lineno ($set)

Return (if $set is undefined) or set current line number.

=item $parser->parse ($string)

Parse the $string as verilog text.  Can be called multiple times.  Note not
all callbacks may be invoked until the eof method is called.

=item $parser->parse_file ($filename);

This method can be called to parse text from a file.  The argument can
be a filename or an already opened file handle. The return value from
parse_file() is a reference to the parser object.

=item $parser->parse_preproc_file ($preproc);

This method can be called to parse preprocessed text from a predeclared
Verilog::Preproc object.

=item $parser->unreadback ($string)

Return any input string from the file that has not been sent to the
callback.  This will include whitespace and tokens which did not have a
callback.  (For example comments, if there is no comment callback.)  This
is useful for recording the entire contents of the input, for
preprocessors, pretty-printers, and such.

With the optional argument, set the text to be returned with the next
unreadback call.  See also unreadbackCat, which is much faster.

To use this option, "use_unreadback => 1" must have been passed to the
constructor.

=item $parser->unreadbackCat ($text)

Add text to be returned with the next unreadback call.  This is much faster
than using "$parser->unreadback($parser->unreadback . $text)".

=back

=head1 CALLBACKS

In order to make the parser do anything interesting, you must make a
subclass where you override one or more of the following callback methods
as appropriate.

=over 4

=item $self->attribute ( $token )

This method is called when any text in (* *) are recognized.  The first
argument, $token, is the contents of the attribute including the delimiters.

=item $self->comment ( $token )

This method is called when any text in // or /**/ comments are recognized.
The first argument, $token, is the contents of the comment including the
comment delimiters.

=item $self->endparse ( $token )

This method is called when the file has been completely parsed, at the
End-Of-File of the parsed file.  It is useful for writing clean up
routines.

=item $self->keyword ( $token )

This method is called when any Verilog keyword is recognized.
The first argument, $token, is the keyword.

=item $self->number ( $token )

This method is called when any number is recognized.  The first argument,
$token, is the number.  The Verilog::Language::number_value function may be
useful for converting a Verilog value to a Perl integer.

=item $self->operator ( $token )

This method is called when any symbolic operator (+, -, etc) is recognized.
The first argument, $token, is the operator.

=item $self->preproc ( $token )

This method is called when any Verilog preprocessor `command is recognized.
Most of these are handled by the preprocessor, however any unrecognized
`defines are passed through.  For backward compatibility, if not defined
this function will call the symbol callback.

=item $self->string ( $token )

This method is called when any text in double quotes are recognized, or on
the text of protected regions.  The first argument, $token, is the contents
of the string including the quotes.

=item $self->symbol ( $token )

This method is called when any Verilog symbol is recognized.  A symbol is
considered a non-keyword bare-word.  The first argument, $token, is the
symbol.

=item $self->sysfunc ( $token )

This method is called when any Verilog $syscall is recognized.  The first
argument, $token, is the symbol.  For backward compatibility, if not
defined this function will call the symbol callback.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

Here's a simple example which will print every symbol in a verilog
file.

  package MyParser;
  use Verilog::Parser;
  @ISA = qw(Verilog::Parser);

  # parse, parse_file, etc are inherited from Verilog::Parser
  sub new {
      my $class = shift;
      #print "Class $class\n";
      my $self = $class->SUPER::new();
      bless $self, $class;
      return $self;
  }

  sub symbol {
      my $self = shift;
      my $token = shift;

      $self->{symbols}{$token}++;
  }

  sub report {
      my $self = shift;

      foreach my $sym (sort keys %{$self->{symbols}}) {
	 printf "Symbol %-30s occurs %4d times\n",
	 $sym, $self->{symbols}{$sym};
      }
  }

  package main;

  my $parser = MyParser->new();
  $parser->parse_file (shift);
  $parser->report();

=head1 BUGS

This is being distributed as a baseline for future contributions.  Don't
expect a lot, the Parser is still naive, and there are many awkward cases
that aren't covered.

The parser currently assumes the string it is passed ends on a newline
boundary.  It should be changed to allow arbitrary chunks.

Cell instantiations without any arguments are not supported, an empty set
of parenthesis are required.  (Use "cell cell();", not "cell cell;".)
